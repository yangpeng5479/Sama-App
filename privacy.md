# Privacy Policy for Sama

**Last Updated: February 26, 2026**

Sama ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Sama mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

### 1. Data Collection and Use
We believe that your personal information belongs to you. Therefore, Sama **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data. All app features are functional without requiring a user account or any personal identification.

### 2. Location Data (On-Device Processing)
To provide accurate prayer times and Qibla direction, the App requires access to your device's GPS location. 
* **Local Processing:** All location-based calculations are performed exclusively on your device.
* **No Transmission:** Your location coordinates are never sent to our servers or any third-party servers.
* **No Storage:** We do not keep a history of your location data.

### 3. Data Security
Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal data stored on our systems that could be compromised. For data stored locally on your device, we rely on the industry-standard security protocols provided by Apple's iOS.

### 4. Third-Party Services
Sama does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking SDKs. We do not sell or share any information because we do not have it.

### 5. Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone.
